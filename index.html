        <h1>What is the purpose of a README file?</h1>
        <p>
          A README file serves as the front page and documentation hub for a project. 
          It explains the project's purpose, functionality, and value proposition to visitors. 
          The README typically includes installation instructions, usage examples, configuration details, 
          and guidelines for contributing. It helps users quickly understand whether the project meets 
          their needs, how to get started, and how to troubleshoot common issues. For developers, 
          it provides technical details about dependencies, APIs, and development setup. 
          A well-written README improves project adoption, reduces support requests, and makes 
          the codebase more accessible to both users and potential contributors.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual guide that outlines the structure of a website or app.
          It shows the placement of content, features, and navigation elements clearly.
          Wireframes help teams plan the user experience and organize information effectively.
          They make it easier to communicate ideas, gather feedback, and identify issues early.
          By focusing on structure rather than design, wireframes save time and improve project efficiency.

        <h3>What is a branch in Git?</h3>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development within a repository.
          It allows developers to work on new features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main code.
          Branches make it easy to test changes and collaborate with others safely.
          They can later be merged back into the main branch once the work is complete.
          Using branches helps organize work, reduce errors, and maintain a stable codebase.
